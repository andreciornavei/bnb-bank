## Turno, formerly TurnboverBnB - Test

This is a test proposed by Turno to build a simplified Bank System using PHP/Laravel and ReactJS.

This project contains the entire application splitted in folders/subprojects (frontend, backend and documentation) and make use of GitHub Pipeline CI to deploy each subproject as needed.

Still, AWS infrastructure is being used to release the project and all its resources is provisioned by IaC using serverless framework on each subproject (backend/frontend) folders.

MongoDB is being used for database.
